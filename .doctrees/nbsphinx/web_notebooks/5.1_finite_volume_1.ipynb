    "#### Dimensions\n",
    "Recall the square brackets notation $\\left[ \\cdot \\right]$ is used to indicate the dimension of the term preceding it.\n",
    "The basic dimensions are mass $M$, time $T$, length $L$ and temperature $\\Theta$. It is permissible to compare, equate, add or subtract only those physical quantities that have the same dimensions. In other words, every term in an expression describing a physical system must have the same dimesions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Fluxes\n",

    "\n",
    "A **flux** is something that flows through a surface or substance.  In our example, we can conceive of the water (or sulfate) as flowing across the boundary of the TMF (our control volume). The rate at which the mass flows across the boundary is a **mass flux**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fluxes are typically defined in two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "* as a **total flux**, which is the rate that the total amount of a quantity enters a volume.\n",
    "* as a **specific flux**, which is the rate per unit area of boundary that a quantity enters a volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: mass is entering a volume at the rate of $30~kg/s$. The area of the boundary that is crossed to enter the volume is $10~m^2$. Then:\n",
    "* the total flux $J=30~kg/s$.\n",
    "* the specific flux $j=3~kg/(s\\cdot m^2)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "More generally, $J= {j A}$, where $A$ is the area normal to the direction that a quantity enters the volume:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"figures/flux_normal-area.png\" style=\"width: 200px;\" >\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So if over the time period $\\Delta t$ a mass of $m_{in}$ flowed into the TMF,\n",
    "the **total mass flux**, $J_{m~{in}} ~ \\left[{M\\over T}\\right] $ is\n",

    "* ${J}$ is notation for the total flux.\n",
    "* $j$ is notation for a specific flux.\n",

Because mass is entering the TMF from the pit, $J_1$ will be greater than or equal to zero ($J_1\\ge0$), and because mass is leaving at the discharge structure, $J_2$ will be less than or equal to zero ($J_2\\le0$).\n",
