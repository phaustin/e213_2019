- Participation: 5 % (clickers);

- Project: 20 %

- Final exam: 15%.

Due dates
==========

* February 28, March 14, March 28.

* Project Due Date: April 2nd

Project information
===================

* You will work in groups of 3 and prepare a computational project of your choosing. We will ask for 1-page project proposals on Thursday, February 28, so start thinking about projects now. Your final deliverable will be a notebook that describes your project and contains your code.

* Coding with partners is known to produce better results. See  The Friendship that Made Google Huge: Link (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.

Criteria
--------

* Define a geological engineering-related computational problem with a clear objective.
* Describe the conceptual model, problem framework or computational issue. Demonstrate an understanding of the issues or fundamental processes related to the computational problem.
* Develop a computational description of the system - this could be mathematical, or statistical   (data analysis or visualization). The description should include, if appropriate, diagrams, important parameters and their ranges.
* Produce a working code for the computational problem.
Provide an interpretation of the results, discuss any limitations, etc.
* We will provide a list of possible projects but I encourage you to develop your own.

Example topics
--------------

* generalization of problems discussed in class to more complex situations (heterogeneous material properties, chemical reactions, etc).
* computation of rock-fall trajectories on mountain slopes
computation of a rock or soil mass sliding down a surface
* determination of material properties by analysis of test results
* risk or Monte Carlo analysis of uncertainty
* model of streamlines in subsurface groundwater flow
* model of soil consolidation or liquefaction
* Evaluation will consider project difficulty, complexity, and novelty, appropriateness and quality of computational method, quality of python implementation and presentation of results and visualization (if appropriate).

* The project should represent 20 to 40 hours total effort per person between now and the project due date.
