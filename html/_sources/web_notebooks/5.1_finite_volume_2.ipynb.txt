    "Recall that our problem is to compute the steady-state sulfate concentration profile with depth in the top two meters of tailings at the bottom of the TMF under the assumptions that:\n",
    "\n",
    "* the TMF pond has a large surface area, and we are computing the profile in the middle of the TMF away from the edge.\n",
    "* the concentration in the water in the TMF pond does not change in time and is fixed at $c=93~mg/L$\n",
    "* the concentration at $2~m$ depth in the sediments does not change in time and is fixed at $c=2000~mg/L$\n",
    "* sulfate is not produced in the top $2~m$ of the tailings.\n",

    "Can we even solve this problem? Our diffusion problem is an example of a class of problems called **boundary value problems** where the goal is to determine the value of the dependent variable (here, concentration) inside the problem domain when we know the dependent variable  or its derivative(s) on the boundary of the domain. We'll revisit this later when we relate the discrete approximation to a partial differential equation.\n",

How? You probably guessed, it must have something to do with conservation principles.\n",
